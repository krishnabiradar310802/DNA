                    <p class="secondary-dark text-center">DNAnalyzer identifies proteins, amino acids, start and stop codons, high coverage regions, regions susceptible to neurodevelopmental disorders, transcription factors, and regulatory elements. Researchers are working to extract valuable
                        information from such software to better understand human health and disease. Currently, we have a Command-Line-Interface (CLI) and are working on a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that will enable physicians to quickly and more
                        easily interact with the software, enabling them to identify genetic mutations that may cause disease.

                    <h2 class="primary-dark">Background</h2>
                    <p class="secondary-dark text-center">The human genome is composed of over 3 billion base pairs, making human analysis nearly impossible. Consequently, using powerful computational and statistical methods to decode the functional information hidden in DNA sequences are
                        necessary. The genome is also extremely intricate and contains a plethora of data, which need to be organized and converted into analyzable data appropriately. Current analytical tools and software make it arduous for both geneticists
                        and physicians to do so, thus restricting them from acquiring crucial information to better understand humans.</p>

                        <p class="definition">A group of disorders, usually characterized by longer genes, that affect the development of the brain and nervous system. These disorders are caused by genetic mutations that affect the development of the brain and nervous system.
                            These disorders include autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and schizophrenia. <code>4</code>
