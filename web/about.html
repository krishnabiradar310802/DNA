                <p class="secondary-dark text-center">Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Piyush, a freshman at Interlake High School
                    interested in SWE and ML. I'm highly passionate about exploring different ways in which I can
                    advance my skills in the branches of science while also tying it with my passion
                    for computer science. Growing up in the Pacific Northwest, Iâ€™ve witnessed the forefront of STEM and
                    innovation on my doorstep. This inspired my love for problem-solving and creating early on, from
                    doing competitive math/science
                    to coding my first Python game. I've competed in a variety of science tournaments, and I recently
                    traveled to Washington, D.C. to compete in the National Science Bowl hosted by the U.S. Department
                    of Energy, where my team and I
                    won first place. I am also committed to developing large-scale open source projects - I have created
                    and contributed to numerous projects on GitHub. When I'm not studying for upcoming competitions and
                    tests, you can usually find
                    me at my computer, tinkering away at a bioinformatics algorithm I invented for analyzing proteins in
                    DNA. In addition to my passion for science and technology, I'm deeply committed to giving back to my
                    community. This is why I
                    joined Mighty Crayon 2 years ago, with the mission of encouraging enjoyable and empowering
                    experiences for children around the world through the use of recycled creative mediums. Today, as
                    the Co-Executive Director, I have set
                    a goal to deliver 100,000+ crayons and educational coloring books to children in need around the
                    world by the end of 2023. Additionally, I am a Curriculum Developer Intern at the Nuevo Foundation,
                    where I develop curricula for
                    underprivileged students, including interactive courses for Python, Linux, EV3, cybersecurity, and
                    other topics pertaining to technology. In my spare time, I enjoy playing the piano, tennis,
                    swimming, and exploring the extensive
                    Redmond trail system near my home either with my family or my DJI Mavic 3.</p>
