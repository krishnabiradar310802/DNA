DNAnalyzer is built by a large team of engineers, designers, researchers, robots, and others in many different sites across the globe. It is updated continuously, and built with more tools and technologies than we can shake a stick at. If you'd like to help us out, see www.github.com/Verisimilitude11/DNAnalyzer. We're always looking for more talent, and we're always looking for more ideas. If you have any suggestions, please let us know! We're always looking for ways to improve the site. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us at contact@dnanalyzer.live. We'd love to hear from you!
